Iâ€™m an engineering graduate, having passion for solving problems methodically and learning how the world around us obeys laws of calculus and physics, and how we interpret them with science. My goal in life is to reach the cutting-edge of science and contribute to pushing the boundaries of it as much as I can. Through my bachelor studies control theory, robotics and dynamic systems engineering gained my interest. I also have hands on experience in electronics and designing mechatronic systems. I like taking on the challenge to do things I am unfamiliar with and learn through process, and done many side projects which taught me valuable lessons and experience. I am keen to pursue my education and research in any relevant field to robotics or dynamic systems.
